Percentages represent implemented operational foundations and visible workflows, not final polish.

Latest Inventory UI polish pass completed on 2026-06-03; follow-up dark cockpit cleanup removed remaining white/light surfaces and added stock-health donut analytics. Inventory Sprint B Warehouse Locations completed on 2026-06-05 with location CRUD, row/column/level/capacity fields, active/soft-delete lifecycle, location stock statistics, and current `warehouse_zones` audit. Operational percentage remains 100%.

Dashboard increased to 45% on 2026-06-07 after replacing the placeholder overview with a real API-backed cockpit using Projects, Production, Components, Inventory, Yard, QC, Activity Logs, and Notifications data. System detail pages remain Settings 55% because mutation workflows for users, roles, settings, audit export, backup execution, and notification read-state are still Phase S2.

Production increased to 78% on 2026-06-12 after Sprint 4 added `ProductionMaterialConsumption`, consume APIs, `CONSUME` material ledger writes, and a Production Cockpit consumption tab for issued/returned/consumed/scrap/remaining quantities.

Components increased to 83% and Production increased to 80% on 2026-06-12 after Sprint 5 added persisted component costing, costing recalculation APIs, material actual cost from production consumption and Inventory average cost, and a Component detail Costing section.

Components increased to 86% and Projects increased to 55% on 2026-06-12 after Sprint 6 added `SHIPPED -> DELIVERED -> INSTALLED` lifecycle APIs, Project Components delivery/install actions, timeline rows, and delivered/installed runtime counters.

Components increased to 88% and Projects increased to 58% on 2026-06-12 after Sprint 7 added install Zone/Axis/Level/Position fields, required install mapping payloads, Project install modal, Project Components install-location columns, Component Detail install location, and runtime mapping fields.

Sprint 8 on 2026-06-12 did not add business workflow percentage. It added read-only Runtime Integrity KPI APIs and documented current reconciliation findings in `docs/ai-state/audits/system-integrity-audit.md`.

Sprint 10A on 2026-06-13 did not add business workflow percentage. It fixed the active Production Material Return path so returned unused issued material is reconciled against consumed/scrap quantities, received back into Main Warehouse, and verified with an issue 10 / consume 8 / scrap 1 / return 1 smoke test.

Sprint 10B on 2026-06-13 did not change module percentages. It connected production completion/component READY workflow to automatic ComponentCosting recalculation and verified `estimatedCost`/`actualCost` update without manual recalculate.

Sprint 10C on 2026-06-13 did not change module percentages. It fixed production reservation allocation to use active exact `inventory_location_stocks` buckets and verified reservation 8 against `A02/L1=10`, `A02/L2=5` with immediate issue success.

Sprint 11 on 2026-06-13 did not change module percentages. It added Component costing material breakdown API/UI and verified planned `VAL-MAT-100` versus actual unplanned `VAL-MAT-002` warning output.
